  Each node of the queue is held in a separate memcache entry.  Nodes are
  deleted upon pop (as opposed to being re-used).  All operations
  on the queue are serialized (i.e. head/tail access is not disjoint).

  This interface is modeled after collections.deque.  Only append and pop
  operations are supported (no length, iteration, clear, etc.).

  Synopsis:

    >>> import memcache
    >>> from memcache_collections import deque
    >>> mc = memcache.Client(['127.0.0.1:11211'], cache_cas=True)
    >>> d = deque.create(mc, 'my_deque')

    >>> d.appendleft('hello')

  then from some other process or machine:

    >>> d = deque.bind(mc, 'my_deque')
    >>> d.pop()
    5
    >>> d.pop()
    'hello'
    >>> d.pop()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    IndexError

  This class is thread safe assuming that the given memcache client is.


  CAVEATS

  Low durability - the collection will be corrupted on loss of any
  underlying memcache entry (e.g. from evictions or memcache server
  restart).  The corruption state is detectable and reported by the
  client library.

  Due to the eviction issue, mixing these collections with other classes
  of data in the same memcache instance is problematic (i.e. less
  important items may corrupt the data structure).  You probably
  want to dedicate a memcache instance to hold fragile data such as these
  collections and manage it so as to not reach the full state.  The
  memcached server has an option to disable evictions (-M) which can help
  in ensuring the system is healthy.

  Regarding CAS ID management, the Python memcache API unfortunately
  requires client implementations to hold on to CAS ID's indefinitely.
  This is problematic for our use case since the number of memcache
  entries using CAS is unbounded.  As a consequence, deque users are
  responsible for managing CAS ID lifetime, for example by calling
  reset_cas() on the given memcache client at appropriate times, and
  perhaps dedicating a memcache client instance soley for use by our
  collections.  As far as this API is concerned, it's safe to call
  reset_cas() outside of any public method.


  PERFORMANCE NOTES

  Very roughly I've seen the deque reach contention limits at ~400
  combined read+write operations/s on a slow laptop and ~1,200 ops/s on
  a decent workstation given small values and the pure Python memcached
  client talking to memcached on the same machine via TCP.

  In applications where exact item ordering is not important, higher
  operation rates can be achieved by application-level sharding to
  multiple deque instances.


  IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

  Based on "CAS-Based Lock-Free Algorithm for Shared Deques",
  Maged M. Michael, 2003,
  http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~mpam092/wiki.files/michael-dequeues.pdf.

  This was the simplest (correct) lock-free algorithm I could find, which
  not surprisingly doesn't allow disjoint access of each queue end.
  Algorithms supporting disjoint access redily exist, such as presented
  in "Lock-Free and Practical Doubly Linked List-Based Deques Using
  Single-Word Compare-and-Swap", Sundell and Tsigas, 2005.  This would
  effectively halve the contention rate when the deque is used as a FIFO,
  but at a considerable complexity cost.

  I'm aware of simple lock-free queue and list implementations which
  attempt to employ memcache's atomic increment operation to generate
  node addresses. However they all seem to suffer from unhandled race
  conditions and it's not obvious to me there is a fix.  Increment can be
  used as a locking mechanism, however.  A locking approach may be more
  fair to clients relative to CAS over a network, but introduces its own
  complexities in needing to address client deaths, deadlocks, etc.

  The implementation assumes that memcache CAS does not suffer from the
  "A->B->A" problem (valid at least for memcached).
